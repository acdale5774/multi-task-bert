In a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework, the training loop is designed to 
optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. This requires carefully structuring 
the data, computing task-specific losses, and ensuring balanced learning across 
tasks. The implementation of the training loop follows standard deep learning 
practices but introduces additional considerations to accommodate the multi-task 
nature of the model.

The training loop assumes the availability of hypothetical data containing labeled 
sentences, where each sentence is associated with two tasks: sentence classification 
and sentiment analysis. The data is preprocessed by tokenizing sentences into input 
tensors and mapping corresponding labels to their respective task heads. Each training 
batch contains a set of sentences with labels for both tasks, ensuring that both 
classification heads receive meaningful updates during backpropagation.

During the forward pass, tokenized input data is passed through the shared BERT 
backbone, producing a contextualized representation of the input. This representation 
is then fed into two separate classification heads, each corresponding to a distinct task. 
The outputs from these heads are logits representing class probabilities for sentence 
classification and sentiment analysis.

The loss function for each task is computed using cross-entropy loss, which is appropriate 
for multi-class classification problems. Since the model simultaneously performs two tasks, 
the total loss is obtained by summing the individual task losses. This approach ensures 
that both tasks contribute equally to training unless task weighting techniques are 
introduced to prioritize one task over another. The optimizer then performs a backward pass 
to update the model’s parameters, adjusting both the shared BERT backbone (if not frozen) 
and task-specific classification heads.

Metrics for evaluating the model’s performance are chosen based on standard classification 
benchmarks. Accuracy is used to measure the percentage of correct predictions for each task, 
while additional metrics such as F1-score can provide deeper insight into performance across 
imbalanced datasets. After each training epoch, these metrics are logged to track the model’s 
improvement over time.

Throughout the training process, the learning rate and batch size are key hyperparameters that 
influence convergence. A lower learning rate is typically used to fine-tune pre-trained models, 
preventing drastic weight updates that could erase previously learned representations. 
Additionally, techniques such as gradient clipping may be implemented to stabilize training 
when dealing with large gradients.

In conclusion, training a Multi-Task Learning model requires handling multiple objectives while 
maintaining efficient learning dynamics. The training loop ensures that both task-specific 
classification heads receive adequate updates while leveraging shared knowledge from the 
transformer backbone. Proper loss computation, optimization strategies, and metric tracking 
enable balanced learning, ultimately improving performance across both tasks.
